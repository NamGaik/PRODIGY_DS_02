🚢 Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project focuses on performing thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset, one of the most popular datasets for learning data science and machine learning.


📁 Dataset Used
The dataset used is: Titanic.csv

The dataset contains information on passengers aboard the Titanic, including:
Demographics (age, gender), Class of travel, Fare paid, Survival outcome, Family onboard, etc


🎯 Objectives
1. Data Cleaning:-
     a. Handle missing values in features like Age, Cabin, and Embarked
     b. Convert categorical variables to appropriate types
     c. Remove or impute outliers where necessary

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):-
     a. Understand the distribution of key variables
     b. Explore relationships between variables (e.g., survival vs. gender,         class, age)
     c. Identify trends and hidden patterns through visualizations

3. Feature Understanding:-
     a. Analyze the impact of individual features on survival rates
     b. Use plots to visually interpret correlations and distributions


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
    1. Python 3
    2. Pandas – for data manipulation
    3. Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization
    4. NumPy – for numerical operations
